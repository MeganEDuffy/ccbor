## Assessing water quality near fracking injection well sites in the Columbus Metro watersheds to protect drinking water
### Columbus, Ohio

[Columbus Community Bill of Rights (CCBOR)](https://columbusbillofrights.org/) was formed in 2014 by a group of concerned citizens  in order to protect their water from oil and gas industrial harms. CCBOR is a grassroots, all-volunteer group that believes all people have inalienable rights to safe water, soil, and air, as well as the right of local self-governance to prohibit substances and activities that would violate those rights. CCBOR also recognizes the rights of ecosystems and natural communities within the city to be free from such harmful activities. Throughout their four campaigns more than 50,000 Columbus residents have signed their petitions.
